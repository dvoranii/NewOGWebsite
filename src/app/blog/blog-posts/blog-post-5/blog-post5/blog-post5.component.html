                5 Basic Keys To A Productive Studio Session</h2>

            <p>
                Whether you're looking to book your first recording session, or if you just need to gain some
                perspective on your music, we’ve isolated five of the most foundational keys to success for independent
                recording artists:

            <p>
                <span class="blog-subtitle">1. Prepare and Practice</span><br>

                Some people just want to mess around and have a good time in the studio. If that’s you, then by
                all means show up with nothing prepared. But be warned, you will never attain the results you desire and
                your lack of experience or commitment will undoubtedly shine through and overshadow all of your positive
                qualities! This is the fundamental question you need to ask yourself as an artist: am I prepared to
                treat my music as a job? If so, you need to be working on your career full-time. That doesn’t mean you
                should quit your day job - just that you should be making the best use of whatever time you can spare.
                Always be writing, practicing and looking for opportunities to perform.

                <span class="blog-subtitle">2. Find the Right Studio For You</span><br>

                A good studio can suit any artist’s needs. If you have the budget, a high-end studio will get you the
                best
                results. If you’re just starting out however, it’s likely that you won’t be able to make the best out of
                that expensive hourly price tag. As a beginner or independent artist, there are a few factors to
                consider when looking for a studio. The most important are: genre-appropriateness, sound quality, and
                price. To get a more in-depth look at each of these factors and what they mean, check out our post on
                <a routerLink="/blog/how-to-find-a-rap-studio-near-you" href="/blog/how-to-find-a-rap-studio-near-you"
                    class="blog-link">&nbsp;"How to Find a Rap Studio Near You"&nbsp;</a>. The most important point,
                which can’t be stressed enough, is to find
                a studio in your price range that will allow you to book at least two to three hours of recording per
                week. At the end of the day, getting the hours in behind the mic will be the most essential component of
                your success as an artist.

                <span class="blog-subtitle">3. Communicate with Your Engineer</span><br>

                This one could be an article all on its own (and it is). One of the biggest killers in a recording
                session is when the artist and the audio engineer aren’t communicating clearly. It’s the audio
                engineer’s job to keep the pace of your studio session and make sure that you’re getting the service you
                paid for. However, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been recording an artist who seems completely
                oblivious to the fact that I’m not a mind reader. The flow of a studio session is a collaborative
                process between the artist and the engineer. So, here are a couple tips to keep the communication up
                from the artist side:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Vocalize what you’re doing. If you want to take another run at the last take, or move on to the next
                    session, or punch in from a specific word or bar. If you need a minute to rewrite a line or rethink
                    a part of the song, let your engineer know.</li>
                <li>Learn some lingo. The other day I overheard a discussion between an artist and their engineer. The
                    artist said “my vocals are too hot, can you make them more fluffy?” Often, the job of an engineer is
                    to interpret what the artist means when they say these kinds of things. The problem is, when one
                    artist says “fluffy” it might mean the exact opposite of what another artist means when they say the
                    same thing. In that situation, the engineer eventually figured out that the artist just wanted more
                    reverb. Here are a few terms you can look up to get you started: reverb, echo, delay, punch,
                    latency/latent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                And of course, it doesn’t all fall on you. If your engineer isn’t communicative, despite your best
                efforts, it might be time to have a frank conversation with them - or look elsewhere. There are a lot of
                audio engineers out there, so don’t be afraid to shop around until you find someone that suits you.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="blog-subtitle">4. Take Care of Your Voice</span><br>
                Warm up, warm up, warm up! At the very least, you should be spending ten to fifteen minutes before your
                studio session doing some light vocal exercises so that you are ready to record before you step up to
                the microphone. You may think that you are the exception to the rule, but that is not a mindset for
                success. If you don’t warm up your voice before the session, you will end up warming it up in the booth
                anyways (and you can throw your first ten takes straight in the garbage).

                In addition to warming up your voice, you need to take care of it while you are outside the studio if
                you want to perform at your best. This should go without saying but smoking, drinking, fried foods and
                sugar are all terrible for your vocal chords. Again, you might be one of the multitude out there who
                will tell their audio engineer “smoking makes my voice sound better,” but let me just break that
                rationalization for you: it doesn’t. Your audio engineer will likely be polite and agree, because it’s
                not their place to make life decisions for you. But in the back of their head, they will see where your
                priorities lie.

            </p>

            <p>
                <span class="blog-subtitle">5. Have a Plan for Your Songs</span><br>

                Okay, so you’ve written your song and practiced it to death before coming to the studio. You’ve found
                the right studio and you have a good workflow with your engineer. Your voice is warmed up and ready to
                go. Now that it’s time to hop in the booth and get down to business, let’s not let all of that
                preparation go to waste. You need to have a plan! This is different than simply having a well-written
                main vocal that you know inside and out; there’s a lot more that goes into a song than the main vocal
                line. Plan out your harmonies, your adlibs, and any cool effects that you might want to try out with
                your engineer. Picturing the finished product is a difficult skill to learn, but over time it will pay
                tremendous dividends. Use the following strategies to develop your ear for detail:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Listen to the music you like and deconstruct it. What is going on in the song besides the artist’s
                    main vocal? Maybe they have two or three layers stacked together, or really spacey sounding adlibs.
                    Maybe they use beat cuts effectively to control the momentum of the song. If you like the way
                    something sounds but don’t know how to describe it, ask your engineer to explain it to you.</li>
                <li>Think in terms of layers. Most songs you hear on the radio have a lot more going on than you hear
                    initially. A pop song might have dozens upon dozens of vocal layers. Even a rap vocal might have two
                    or three main vocal takes stacked on top of each other plus doubles, adlibs or overdubs.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Following these tips will get you on your way to realizing your goals as an artist. Stay tuned for more in-depth tips on developing your skills and knowledge.</p>
