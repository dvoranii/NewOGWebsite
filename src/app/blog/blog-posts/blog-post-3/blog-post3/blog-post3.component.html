            <p>
                In our <a routerLink="/blog/5-basic-keys-to-a-productive-studio-session"
                    href="/blog/5-basic-keys-to-a-productive-studio-session" class="blog-link"> &nbsp;“5 Basic Keys to a
                    Productive Studio Sesson”&nbsp;</a> article, we discussed several criteria that you as
                an artist should consider before making a studio your permanent home. We’ll dive into those below, but
                first I’d like to address one common pitfall that plagues artists of all styles and genres: the friend
                with a studio. Almost every artist hits this stage of their development, where they are courted by a
                friend with a fledgling studio and the promise of free or inexpensive recording time.

                Now it is important to note that most studios these days start as small, home-based operations, and
                there are lots of very talented engineers working independently out of their home studios. However, if
                you are going to work with a friend, be sure that your lines of communication are open. It’s crucial
                that both parties understand the pricing and time involved, and that either party can discontinue their
                relationship and look elsewhere without feelings being hurt. It can be a great experience to begin
                recording with a buddy who has a microphone and a copy of Ableton Live or FL Studio. However, as an
                artist you must understand that as you mature and develop your craft, you will eventually need to
                outgrow this environment and start budgeting for a professional studio. With that said, here are the
                three most important criteria for finding yourself a good fit when looking for a studio:

                <span class="blog-subtitle">Genre-Appropriateness:</span><br>

                There are a million studios out there for you to choose from, and they will all tell you that they are
                the perfect fit for your music. If you are only recording vocals, your money will likely be wasted by
                booking an expensive studio equipped with drum kits, guitar amps, and racks of outboard gear. This
                equipment is inherent in the hourly price of the studio, and won’t bring you any benefit. A smaller
                vocal studio that specializes in the same genres you like will get you much further for a lower price
                tag. While the big fancy studio with leather couches on the live floor and guitars all over the wall
                might feel like a flex, it’s really not necessary unless you are recording a full band. What’s worse, a
                studio that specializes in recording rock or metal might have limited experience with the techniques
                needed to make a popular rap anthem. When you find a studio, check their website and their Instagram to
                see what kind of artists record there. If they don’t resemble your style of music at all, keep looking.

                <span class="blog-subtitle">Sound Quality:</span><br>

                This one is pretty simple. Most studios sound good, but make sure to do your homework and check out some
                of their portfolio. The best thing to do is find a decent set of speakers (e.g. NOT your phone or laptop
                speakers) to listen to some of their work and make sure it sounds appropriate. If the vocals sound too
                quiet, unclear, washed out, or out of time, look elsewhere. Don’t forget, every studio makes songs that
                don’t sound good. Not every song should see the light of day. But the songs they choose to put out on
                their platforms should reflect the very best that they have to offer.

                <span class="blog-subtitle">Price:</span><br>

                We’ve saved the best for last. If you’re a rapper on a budget, you may already realize that the biggest
                determining factor in your studio choice will be the hourly price for recording. For some, price is not
                as much of a factor. Regardless, you should pick a price range that reflects your commitment to
                succeeding as an artist. In order to grow, you should make the recording studio a part of your weekly
                routine. If you can budget a few hundred dollars a month for your music, booking two hour sessions every
                week will help you develop the all-important cycle of constantly writing and recording new material.

                Considering these factors, it shouldn’t be too hard to find a studio that is a good fit for you. Don’t
                be afraid to try out a couple studios and shop around, there’s no obligation. Additionally, make sure
                that you can work well with the staff there. It’s not just about equipment and price -- at the end of
                the day, it is the people running the studio that will determine the fate of your song.
